            <h3>Geography</h3>
            <p>Its surface was almost entirely covered in ice floes and icebergs that crowded and completely covered
                the ocean. The only open body of water was the Styx, which kept its dark, oily water separated from the
                saltwater and meandered through the layer as if it were crossing a plain.<br>
                The sky of Stygia was in a state of perpetual twilight and was constantly struck by lightning, which
                made it extremely dangerous for flying creatures. Thunder swept the land in a continuous
                rumble.<br>
